<h3>The Quick Version</h3>

    regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
    We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
</p>
<p>
    Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.
    Conference participants violating these rules will be sanctioned or expelled from the conference
    without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

<h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>

    Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability,
    physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
    stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
    inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

    Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized
    images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (<em>including volunteers</em>) should not
